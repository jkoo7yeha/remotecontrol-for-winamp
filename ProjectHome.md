**Control the Winamp with your Android phone!**


The combination of the RemoteControl plugin for Winamp and the Android app allows fast and easy control of the Winamp playback over wifi. The plugin synchronizes Winamp with the app so you can sit on the sofa while browsing through your favourite playlist.

Features:
  * playback control
  * browse your playlist
  * cover files transmission
  * display track information
  * queuing tracks
  * playback is paused on incoming call

Necessary is Winamp version 5.5 or later.

The Winamp plugin is available in the [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/remotecontrol-for-winamp/downloads/list). The app can be found on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RemoteControl&hl=de).

See also [Node.js bindings by Mikito Takada](https://github.com/mixu/node-winamp) to control Winamp from the command line as well!

**Enjoy!**
